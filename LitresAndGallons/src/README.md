# Coversion Scripts

These are two scripts - one will take the price of gas per litre, and convert it to the price in USD and US Gallons
The other will take the price of gas in USD and US Gallons and convert it to CAD Canadian Dollars and the price per litre.
I used the forex_python to convert the currencies.
